                    <h3>When should we place our school diary order?</h3>
                    <p>We recommend placing your order at least 8-10 weeks before you need the diaries. For academic year diaries, most schools order in April-May for delivery before the new academic year in June.</p>

                    <h3>What paper quality do you recommend for school diaries?</h3>
                    <p>For student diaries, we typically recommend 80-100 GSM paper for interior pages which balances durability with cost-effectiveness. Cover pages are usually 250-300 GSM with lamination for added durability.</p>
