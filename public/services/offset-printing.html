            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Offset Printing</h2>
            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the difference between offset and digital printing?</h3>
                    <p>Offset printing uses plates and rubber blankets to transfer ink to paper, while digital printing applies toner or ink directly to the paper without plates. Offset printing offers superior quality and cost-effectiveness for larger quantities, while digital printing is better for smaller runs and variable data printing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What minimum quantity do you recommend for offset printing?</h3>
                    <p>Offset printing becomes cost-effective typically at quantities of 500 or more pieces due to the setup and plate-making costs. For smaller quantities, digital printing may be more economical.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What file formats do you accept for offset printing?</h3>
                    <p>We accept print-ready PDF files with embedded fonts, CMYK color mode, and proper bleed settings. We can also work with Adobe Illustrator (.ai), InDesign (.indd), and Photoshop (.psd) files with all linked images and fonts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does offset printing take?</h3>
                    <p>Standard offset printing jobs typically take 3-7 business days from approval to delivery, depending on complexity, quantity, and finishing requirements. Rush services are available for urgent projects.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you offer design services for offset printing projects?</h3>

                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
