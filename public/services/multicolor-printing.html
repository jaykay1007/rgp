            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Multicolor Printing</h2>
            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the difference between CMYK and Pantone color printing?</h3>
                    <p>CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) is a four-color process that creates colors by combining these four inks in different proportions. It's ideal for full-color images but may not precisely match specific brand colors. Pantone colors are pre-mixed, specific ink formulations that ensure exact color matching, particularly important for brand consistency.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do you ensure color consistency across different print runs?</h3>
                    <p>We maintain color consistency through calibrated equipment, standardized color profiles, controlled lighting conditions for color evaluation, and by keeping detailed records of ink formulations. For recurring projects, we store color specifications and settings to ensure consistency over time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What paper types work best for multicolor printing?</h3>
                    <p>Coated papers (gloss, silk, or matte) typically provide the best surface for multicolor printing, offering excellent ink holdout and color vibrancy. However, our techniques can accommodate uncoated and specialty papers as well, with adjustments to the printing process to optimize results.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you match our brand colors exactly?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, using the Pantone Matching System (PMS), we can match your brand colors with high precision. For best results, provide us with your Pantone color codes or physical samples that we can match using spectrophotometer technology.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the minimum order quantity for multicolor printing?</h3>
                    <p>While we can accommodate smaller orders, multicolor offset printing becomes most cost-effective at quantities of 500+ pieces due to setup costs and plate creation. For smaller quantities, we may recommend digital printing options.</p>

                    <h3>How should I prepare my files for multicolor printing?</h3>
                    <p>For best results, provide high-resolution files (300 dpi or higher) in CMYK color mode with fonts embedded or converted to outlines. Include 3mm bleed for any design extending to the edge of the page. We accept print-ready PDFs, Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop files.</p>
